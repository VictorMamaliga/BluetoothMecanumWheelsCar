## Description

This car utilizes Mecanum wheels to achieve omnidirectional movement. The car is controlled with a Bluetooth connected device, which sends commands to the Arduino onboard the car.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to setup and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following:

- An Arduino board
- 4x Mecanum wheels

- 4x 3D printed adapters (between wheels and motors)![image](https://github.com/VictorMamaliga/BluetoothMecanumWheelsCar/assets/92131932/a7ff8aa1-884e-48fa-b65d-facd39460e7c)

- 3D printed chassis 
- Bluetooth module (HC-05 or similar)
- 4x Motors
- 2x Motor drivers
- Jumper Wires

### Installation 

1. Assemble the car with Mecanum wheels and connect the motors to the Arduino through the motor drivers.
2. Connect the Bluetooth module to the Arduino.
3. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BluetoothMecanumWheelsCar.git
